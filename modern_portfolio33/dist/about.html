            <h1>Growing Up</h1> I have been interested in technology since I was
            about.... 5 years of age. If I had an opportunity to disassemble
            anything, and I mean anything.... I would. In the 90's my first
            computer was a macintosh. The only piece of software that I knew how
            to operate was the jigsaw puzzle game. I would spend hours putting
            together the same 6 different images. It was no mind blowing game, I
            just prefered to spend my time on the computer... Okay! Who am I
            fooling? I LOVED being around a computer regardless the mindless
            task. Over time, I learned how to make my way around the operating
            system through trial and error. Thank god for the back button! As
            time passed, machines and I have bonded, or maybe not.. Linux
            repositories still get the best of me. Anyways, I understand enough
            to the point people subconsciously think I am a genius and have a
            degree in Computer Science. I do not. And for the genius part, we
            are all geniuses in our own way. Habit, as well as chiseling our
            skills to perfection is what creates a pro. I just happen to have a
            habit of spending disgustingly mass amount of time on computers.
            Don't get me wrong, I won't pass up a good hiking adventure, but I
            most likely will be thinking about computers the whole time.

          <p><h1>My Lesiure Time</h1>

            
            

            As any typical guy I had a desire for a place for my lonesome and expirement with cool stuff. A.K.A a mancave. So I used my walk in closet space to build this mancave after extreme bartering with my girlfriend and her need for space for clothes and such... I start my days off in the morning, because you know, "the early bird gets the worm". I head straight to the cave and pick up a project or continue on an unfinished one. I love when my friends devices break, it gives me a project and builds my brownie points. I try my best to stay universal on OS platforms, but I tend to lean more towards linux, Ubuntu 17 to be specific. All the computer knowledge I possess is due to diving head first into the unlimited resources on the internet. I can start on one topic that will branch out to other topics leading to ideas that a majority of the time become reality. For example, I had an idea to build my own server and my own website. It took quite some time and research, but here we are! No matter how intimidating the work ahead of me lies on a project, I don't back down. I start by taking one step at a time until I make it past the finish line. Well, technically there is no finish line due to constant updates and upgrades. You know how there is always version 1.1 or 1.2 right around the corner... Just like myself, always trying to upgrade and update.

            <p><h1>Background</h1>

              A Kansas boy that “Got the hell out of Dodge”. Took root out in LA in 2014 and have been sprouting since. There is not much to look back at except corn fields and cows, so I keep my scope on the prize of growing as an individual in the tech field. When I speak of the “Tech field”, I’m talking about being able to be universal from hardware repair all the way to writing the code to build an app on the android platform, to receiving an annual salary of $100,000 for being an IT Specialist. During my days in Kansas I never once thought about a career, just worked what jobs my application got accepted at. Mostly restaurant and beef plant gigs. A very mediocre lifestyle with no plans of a future. At the time I was not aware of coding and not much education on computers. It wasn’t until I came out to California to see an ad on instagram that lead me into pioneering into programming. Eventually I googled programming and was directed to free coding lessons. I started out with free online classes at cleverprogrammer.com Where Qazi schooled me with the majestic language of Python. I sat down religiously every morning and took notes with breakfast. After about a month in I became distracted with other… well you know.. distractions. Gaining a scholarship in front end web development introduced me to webpages which revived my interest in coding. Eventually my other scholarship, again from google, came along which directed me towards a different aspect of the computer field (IT Specialist). Information Technology, in my perspective, is the more social lifestyle. A programmer speaks to a computer via a computer language, while in the IT Specialist field you’re speaking to people to help fix their computers. Upon completing my scholarship and gaining my certificates, I prefer to take the coding lifestyle, but would never oppose to an IT opportunity. I’ve came to the realization that “Habit is the key to success”, so an hour a day or more of coding is apart of my daily practice.

            I Recieved a full ride scholarship from Google to pursue the
            education in Information Technology. The 8 month course consisted of
            divided information on automation, the importants of networking, the
            basics of the GUI and CLI on Linux and Windows OS, System
            Administration, and lastly Technical Support Fundamentals.

            This 33 week boot camp has broadened my career path opportunities
            immensely. I am still pursuing this intense journey, but I can say I
            have many tools and resources readily available on my belt than I
            possessed in the beginning. As of now I can create a single page
            application using Angular, or use libraries to build applications
            using React. Strong knowledge on HTML and CSS using bootstrap or
            flexbox.
